{"name":"nof1","tagline":"","body":"# Nof1 Trial App\r\n\r\nAn Android app to help the administration and implementation of N-of-1 trials in \r\nhealthcare. The app can provide reminders to take medication, collect information\r\nfrom the patient and display any data collected.\r\n\r\n**Support for this software ended in November 2012.**\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nThe application is being developed for those about to undergo an N-of-1 trial. \r\nIt contains a configuration utility to set up the app which must be completed by \r\nthe clinician or doctor. This will require the contact details of the pharmacist \r\ninvolved in the trial, so that the treatment schedul can be sent directly to them\r\nensuring that both patient and clinician remain blind to this data.\r\n\r\nThe patient will then decide which aspects of the app they would like to use, and\r\nconfigure any preferences they have.\r\n\r\nAt points specified by their treatment plan, the app will give reminders to the \r\npatient to enter the information tracked by the trial and provide feedback over \r\nthe course of treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Build\r\n\r\nThe project is developed in Eclipse. Pulling the source should allow building in \r\neclipse provided that the required plugins are installed:\r\n\r\n - Android development tools\r\n - Google plugin\r\n - App engine SDK\r\n - GWT SDK\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\tCopyright (C) 2012 John Lawson\r\n\r\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n    (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
