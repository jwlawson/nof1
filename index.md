# Nof1 Trial App

An Android app to help the administration and implementation of N-of-1 trials in
healthcare. The app can provide reminders to take medication, collect
information from the patient and display any data collected.

**Support for this software ended in November 2012.**

### Aims
The aims of the app are: 
* To create a random treatment plan to send to the pharmacist
* To allow the patient to easily collect data about their symptoms and quality of life
* To present this data in an easy to understand way
* To send the data back to the doctor running the trial

### Usage

The application is being developed for those about to undergo an N-of-1 trial. 
It contains a configuration utility to set up the app which must be completed by 
the clinician or doctor. This will require the contact details of the pharmacist 
involved in the trial, so that the treatment schedul can be sent directly to them
ensuring that both patient and clinician remain blind to this data.

The patient will then decide which aspects of the app they would like to use, and
configure any preferences they have.

At points specified by their treatment plan, the app will give reminders to the 
patient to enter the information tracked by the trial and provide feedback over 
the course of treatment.

### Build

The project is developed in Eclipse. Pulling the source should allow building in 
eclipse provided that the required plugins are installed:

* Android development tools
* Google plugin
* App engine SDK
* GWT SDK
