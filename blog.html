<h1>Development Blog</h1>

During the development of the application I wrote an accompanying blog
discussing the milestones of development.

<ul>
{% for post in site.posts %}
<li>
{{ post.date | date: "%-d %B %Y" }} &#8212; <a href="{{ site.url }}/{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title}}</a>
{{ post.excerpt }}
</li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
