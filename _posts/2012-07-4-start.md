The project started off on Monday, so now I have had a couple of days to get my
head around what I am doing. Apart from a lot of confusion on my first day,
everything has been going well. My supervisor is enthusiastic and full of ideas
of how to make the app bigger and better.

I have been building up some mock interface elements to help show what the app
might look like, as well as providing a solid base for me to add all the logic
to later. This means lots of editing xml files and trying to coax the android
development tools to play nicely with each other. Currently one source of
frustration is that the Android emulator (or AVD - Android Virtual Device) only
seems to support having one instance running at once. All documentation says
multiple AVDs are possible, and I have even managed to get it working -- once --
but not since then. I currently think it might be something to do with not
having enough memory maybe?  

Today my supervisor and I decided to make the project available as open source
under GPL v3, and its currently hosted on github.
