title: Week 2
---

There haven't been many big advances since Wednesday really, just more of the
same. Slowly building functionality and screens until it all comes together.

Yesterday, my supervisor suggested something that would have been really good to
have done 2 weeks ago was some research into what the end users of the app might
think. This would have allowed us to build it to their exact specifications,
rather trying to guess from articles and papers. So not one to miss out, I
quickly threw together a questionnaire that we could send to doctors and
academics: boom.

Hopefully this will bring in some useful information and not show that the past
two weeks have been a waste of time. Now we just need a list of email addresses
and people to send it to. But this will also be useful in getting a list of
people who are actually interested in the app, so we can send them a copy for
testing and evaluation.
