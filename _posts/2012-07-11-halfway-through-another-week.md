title: Halfway through another week
---

Its been an interesting few days so far this week. Following a meeting with my
supervisor on Monday, I worked on making a way for the doctor to input the
questions for the patient questionnaire. Monday was spent mostly working on
layouts, making things look nice etc. 

Tuesday was when I came to try and make it all work. Oh dear. Pretty much the
whole day was spent fighting with android, trying to find out how the google
guys wanted someone to do these sorts of things. The fragment API is fairly
awesome, but unless you know how it works there are so many brick walls you can
inadvertently walk into it is crazy. And I'm fairly sure I managed to find most
of them.

Today was much better, having finally got the hang of everything, just about. It
is very satisfying going through old code (that is stuff from about a week ago)
and ruthlessly culling bits everywhere. Plus nothing's broken yet.

Overall it's looking quite good, the framework of the app is all coming
together, gradually buttons are doing things, the user experience is becoming
more obvious and its slowly getting there.
