title: Week 1
---

So this is the end of my first week working on the project. Today was a fairly
annoying day, spent almost entirely on drawing a graph -- or rather trying to
get the app to draw a graph that looks good, scales up to any size nicely and
generally is well behaved. Unfortunately Android canvas has a unique property of
having its origin at the upper left corner, as opposed to the more usual lower
left corner. Hence a lot of time was spent basically trying to turn the graph
upside-down -- or is that the right way up. Oh well, its done now.

Now I need to start working on the preferences and configuration tools as well
as trying to get my head around SQLite databases. Then I suppose I might need to
start actually getting some of the buttons doing things other than looking
pretty. 

Yesterday I spent some time making sure the app works correctly in a range of
different screen sizes, versions of android and other arcane set ups.
ActionBarSherlock certainly helps provide a degree of consistency across the
different android versions and using the light theme means those horrific
Gingerbread buttons don't look awful, merely a bit weird. As seen in the last
post, for tablets with wide screens I have included a layout with two columns,
and a fair amount of time was spent working out what screen width was too narrow
for this dual column layout. Turns out to be a bit less than 600dp. Yeah. (That
kind of makes sense, as the radiobuttons are about 250dp width).
