title: Week 3

End of another week, and the questionnaire has finally gone out to the world. It
will be interesting to see where it goes and what we get back. Jeremy has asked
for responses by the end of July, as that is when we are aiming to have v1.0
ready for release however that seems an unlikely deadline if I know academics.
Still, once I have written up the documentation, screenshots and have a Play
link, it should be relatively painless to forward that on to anyone inquiring.

In terms of publishing on Google Play, we are waiting for Finance to give us
the money, then I can set up an account and begin putting together the promo
material. That might mean I have to delve into the world of graphic design, a
daunting prospect. This is only a beta (or possibly alpha) release, so I guess
people can't expect everything to be polished.

The app itself is progressing nicely. I pretty much have all the core stuff
made, its now just a matter of ensuring it all does what it should and make it
nicer and easier to use. Also some of the graphic/design needs a bit of work.
Then, lets see what bugs the (hopefully) massive crowd of testers will find.
It shall be an interesting month, watching the reports come in and seeing
whether it all works, or crashes miserably.

I implemented a rough form of emailing the form data to the doctor and
pharmacist. This was just using an intent that sends the email off to G-Mail,
or whatever other email program the user has. Unfortunately the handling of
attachments in android is weird. In fact it downright doesn't make any sense.

Apparently I can attach a file to an email if the file is stored on the
external SD card, but if the file is on internal storage then it just will not
work. At all. Apart from that one time it did work, when I wasn't expecting
it, but now I can't remember how I managed it and nothing else I do will work.
Sometimes all this android stuff just feels like a massive hack.

On a totally unrelated note, I came home today to a lovely note from my (now
thankfully ex-)housemate saying "Sorry, but I had to break the kitchen door
window to get in". The perfect end to a Friday. The landlord is trying to get
it fixed soon, so that should be alright. At least I will never have to live
with him again.
