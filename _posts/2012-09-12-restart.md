I've been back developing the app for about a week and a half now, having had
August off. It's been a fun week overall barring the pain of moving in and
trying to sort out lots of house problems.

This month I have decided to work on building a web backend for the app. This is
built on Google App Engine, which has the benefit of providing a surprising
amount for free, as well as allowing me to easily get a web application up and
running without having to worry about finding web hosting, fighting with
databases or anything. In fact it is beginning to look a bit like the project is
sponsored by Google or something, what with pretty much everything running
through their servers. 

Over the break, Jeremy bought the app a website at noftrial.org. I've set up a
basic page their to give a bit of information about the project and what we are
doing. This also includes a link to the app engine page.

App engine has made it incredibly easy to include authentification to the web
transactions, allowing users to use an existing google account to upload and
view data. This has meant that adding all this to the android app has been
incredibly easy, and through GWT I have been able to build a webpage that
doesn't look too bad as well.
